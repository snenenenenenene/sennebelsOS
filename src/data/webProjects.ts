This is possible through the online interface, as well as through a scannable QR-code. As I was working on the project as a frontend developer most functionalities are wired through a mock API instead of an actual backend.",

      "However, in February I was offered the opportunity to work on a new project called Bobcat. This project intends to inform users about the decisions their municipality took in Flanders, which is meant to inform voters for the upcoming Flemish election. It's a really important project that I'm excited to be a part of. I've learned so much through my experiences working on Lynx and now Bobcat. It's been amazing to work on projects that have real-world impact and help improve people's lives. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me next and how I can continue to use my skills to make a difference.",

      "After my last year of university, I was eager to gain more professional experience, so I applied to Open Summer of Code. I was thrilled to be placed in the group working for the Flemish Agency of Home Affairs, where we were tasked with creating an app called Lynx. The app gathers and harvests municipal (tax) data and visualizes it intuitively through a plethora of graphs as well as a map. I had such a great experience working on Lynx that I decided to keep working on it even after the hackathon ended. I continued to refine and develop the app, adding new features and improving its functionality.",
